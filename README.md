# Customer-Segmentation-using-Kmeans
Companies want to know what kind of products to make and what type of customers to target their product towards,while customers want to get better products for their needs.This need is solved by customer segmentation. By using machine learning ,customers can be segmented into different categoires depending upon their income and expenditure as this will place the customers with similar behaviour in the same segment.This will help the companies decide what type of customers they want their prodcuts to be targetted towards and estimate the success of their products .This will also help them make better products for the said segments.Using K means we can cluster the customers in different segments and the visualization of this clustering helps in determining the size and posistion of the classes. This technique may also be used in other areas.

#### Setting the number of clusters to 6 seems to provide a more meaningful customer segmentation.
- Cluster 1: Medium income, low annual spend
- Cluster 2: Low income, low annual spend
- Cluster 3: High income, high annual spend
- Cluster 4: Low income, high annual spend
- Cluster 5: Medium income, medium annual spend
- Cluster 6: Very high income, high annual spend


##### Marketing strategies for the customer segments
 Based on the 6 clusters, we could formulate marketing strategies relevant to each cluster: 

- A typical strategy would focus certain promotional efforts for the high value customers of Cluster 6 & Cluster 3.
- A typical strategy would focus certain promotional efforts for the high value customers of Cluster 6 & Cluster 3.
- Cluster 4 is a unique customer segment, where in spite of their relatively lower annual income, these customers tend to spend more on the site, indicating their loyalty. There could be some discounted pricing based promotional campaigns for this group so as to retain them.
- For Cluster 2 where both the income and annual spend are low, further analysis could be needed to find the reasons for the lower spend and price-sensitive strategies could be introduced to increase the spend from this segment.
-Customers in clusters 1 is not spending enough on the site in spite of a good annual income â€”further analysis of these segments could lead to insights on the satisfaction / dissatisfaction of these customers or lesser visibility of the e-commerce site to these customers. Strategies could be evolved accordingly.

## Future scope -
- add density/normal wala graph on income and spending in statistical
- add elbow graph and eplanation
- add market strategy
- add few more graphs if possible.
